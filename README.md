<p id="about">Hello, welcome to Le Prince Travels. We offer trips to to all the places around the world!! Sorry, we are not open as for now <del>probably because we're fake</del>. But we will show you some places to make it up to you. So pack your things and enjoy like a Prince!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<h2 id="sights">SIGHTS TO SEE<br></h2>
<p>In this travel, Le Prince Travels would be tellin' you about some places. These places are real tourists' attractions in the real world and Le prince Travels would enlighten you more on them. So enough of all these big English. The places are; <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Shangrilla lower kachura lake</li><br><br>
<li>Kroatien - Plitvicka Jezera</li><br><br>
<li>Vernal Falls Rainbow</li><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</ul></p>
   
<p id="image1">Shangrilla lower kachura lake<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>   
   
<p>To start with, Shangrilla lower kachura lake OR that I like to call it: <strong>"Gorilla lower spatula lake"</strong>. This place as you can see is a very beautiful place and one of the best tourist attractions in the world. Of course it is, it is a Gorilla lake. <em>It's spatula lake</em>. No it's <strong>lower spatula rake</strong>. So, what other reason do you want to come visiting.  Come on before the owner comes and take away the spatula from gorilla and then it becomes <strong>"Gorilla former spatula lake."</strong>. Thanks for reading we will <del>probably</del> tell the gorilla to prepare for your arrival.<br><em>Waitng you personally</em> - - - - - - - your's faithfully <del>Prince</del><strong>Gorilla</strong></p>   
   
<p id="image3">Kroatien - Plitvicka Jezera<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>   

<p>Even from the name, you can tell that this is a very good place to travel to. I mean what type of a place would be named <strong>Rotten viti-vicka zebra.</strong> Have you even tried pronuncing the name. What type of name would be named with a hyphen if not from a Rotten Zebra. Even though I'm advertising nicely on these places, let me tell you a secret: <del>(look at the bushes first before you come here)</del> because even from it's name, you can tell that this is a very good place to spend your holiday because who wouldn't want to visit an alive and rotten <em>viti-vicka</em> Zebra for goodness sake, who wouldn't want to sleep with such a <del>smelly and</del> very beautiful Zebra living in those bushes for you to <del>kill</del> embrace it. that's not all. look at that destructive and dirty looking lakr that the rotten zebra have bathed in again and again. Well, this is also a tourist attraction as long as you want to go there and drink that pool of madness and bathe in it for a very loooooong time.</p>
   
<p id="image2">Vernal Falls Rainbow<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>  
<p>Wow I know you you would agree with me that this is the most wonderful and beautiful pace we have seen so far. Well if you look closely, you can see the reason why it's so dearly loved and why it's such a valuable tourist attraction. You understand right look at those <del>Ugly</del> <em>beautiful and lovely</em> 'items' on that tree. They're so wonderful that I do not even know what to call them. Looking at this tree alone may even be able to make you <del>get irritated</del> come to visit so why dont you come around and visit <del>all the evils of</del> this <del>ritual</del> tree. <em>You know what I mean.</em></p><br>

<p class="inter">So after reading again and again on these wonderful sights, aren't you hungry. Wondering what you might eat well don't worry, Prince Travels got you covered with some amazing foods and their photos keep reading in order to see the wonderful delicacies present in this journey.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
